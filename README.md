# HelsinkiJS

## Speaker guide

### Talk content

- If you'd like to give a talk, please [submit your proposal via Meetabit](https://www.meetabit.com/communities/helsinkijs/talk_proposals/new) (you need to be signed in to be able to do this).
- The talk description can be only a few sentences, but the talk title should be clear and in line with what you'll talk about.
- The ideal talk is one where you share your personal experience of working on something, the challenges you ran into and how you overcame them OR a niche topic. Introductory talks on frameworks that many people have tried or there are plenty of online materials about are less interesting.
- It is OK to do live coding, but make sure to keep it fairly short and do a test run beforehand, the attendees are not interested in watching you install dependencies or do live debugging. 
- We do not need speaker bios in advance, but do introduce yourself briefly at the beginning of your talk.
- The audience is a mix of mid-level and senior developers and your talk can be very technical, if you want.

### Practical details

- Make yourself known to the organizers when you arrive at the venue. Test your setup in advance.
- The order in which the talks are given is not necessarily the one listed on Meetabit and will be decided on the spot.
- You should bring your own laptop for showing the slides. If you can't, please let the organizers know in advance.
- There are usually HDMI and other video ports available, but this is not guaranteed, so please bring any video adapters you have as well. If you have a clicker and want to use one, please bring that too.
- Talks should be 20 minutes long with 5 minutes for Q&A. We're pretty strict when it comes to timing, so time yourself in advance so you don't overrun. Sponsors get an additional 5 minutes at the beginning to give an intro to their company.
- You do not need to share slides in advance, but it would be great if you could add a link to them to Meetabit after the talk. To do this, go to your talk page and click "Add material".
